# Pythagorean Triplet

A Pythagorean triple is a set of three natural numbers a < b < c, for which a**2 + b**2 = c**2.

For example, 3, 4, and 5 is a Pythagorean triplet, because 3**2 + 4**2 = 5**2.

Given N, check if there exists any Pythagorean triplet a + b + c = N. Return the maximum possible value of a*b*c
among such Pythagorean triplets, if there is no such triplet, return -1.

## Constraints

- 1 <= N <= 3000
